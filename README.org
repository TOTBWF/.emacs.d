* My Emacs Configuration
⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This is my Emacs configuration, which means that I do not promise that
it will work on your system! It is best used as a starting point, and
/not/ something to keep in sync with. The intended use is to fork this
repository, and then let your configuration diverge naturally.

That being said, I do think this is a good starting point for a light-weight
doomlike configuration that's a little less idiosyncratic, and
adhere's more to vanilla emacs standards when it comes to elisp.
* Installation
Fork this repository (see the disclaimer!), and then clone it into =~/.emacs.d=.
